    "introduction": "Consolidated CDA (C-CDA) is one of the most widely implemented implementation guides for CDA and covers a significant scope of clinical care. Its target of the 'common/essential' elements of healthcare is closely aligned with FHIR's focus on the '80%'. There is significant interest in industry and government in the ability to interoperate between CDA and FHIR and C-CDA is a logical starting point. Implementers and regulators have both expressed an interest in the ability to map between FHIR and C-CDA.",
